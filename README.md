# Materialize + Redpanda + dbt Hack Day

Welcome to the first virtual Hack Day hosted by Materialize and our good friends at Redpanda and dbt Labs! The goal of this event is to encourage knowledge-sharing between our communities (we've already learned so much just putting it together!), and give you a taste of what building streaming analytics pipelines with this stack looks like.

## What to expect

Maybe you've never used dbt. Maybe you're new to streaming. Maybe you're even new to dbt _and_ streaming. But guess what: it doesn't really matter!

* [Hack Day Agenda]()

We'll kick things off with a quick intro to each of the projects and go over the guidelines for the event to make sure you're all set! We are of course also giving you [somewhere to start](#where-to-start)!

At the end of the event, we encourage you to share your projects, experiments and learnings in [Show and tell](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/mz-hack-day-2022/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)!

### Asking for help

Throughout the day, folks from all three projects will be available to bounce off ideas, support you with your project or just...chat. To get in touch with us, join the official [Slack channel]() or reach out in [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/mz-hack-day-2022/discussions/categories/troubleshooting)!

### Claiming some swag!

TODO: agree on the minimum requirements for each type of swag (?) and make it clear in this section how to claim it.

## Where to start

Our goal was to guarantee that everyone is able to get up and running in a reasonable amount of time, as well as find something fun to work on regardless of their level of expertise with each tool. For this reason, you can find a [sample project](/sample_project/README.md) in the repo with enough plumbing to spin up an end-to-end setup that you can play around with, extend or completely modify:

</p>

To get started, fork this repo, clone it and navigate to the `sample_project` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/<github-username>/mz-hack-day-2022.git

cd mz-hack-day-2022/sample_project
```

### Where to go from here?

To get the sample project working all the way, you need to _at least_ add a new dbt model that creates a [materialized view](https://materialize.com/docs/overview/api-components/#materialized-views). But there's a lot more you can do â€” choose your own Hack Day adventure! :cowboy_hat_face: In case you need some ideas, here are a few challenges:

| **Tool**       | **Challenge**            |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| Materialize    | Replace the JSON file with a Postgres database that pushes changes to the aircraft reference data into Materialize, either through [Redpanda+Debezium or directly](https://materialize.com/docs/guides/cdc-postgres/)                       |
| Materialize    | Push data from a materialized view to a web app using [`TAIL`](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/tail/). You can use our [Node.js and Materialize guide](https://materialize.com/docs/guides/node-js/) as a reference! |
| Redpanda       | Create a producer for a new data source. [Here] (sample_project/MINI-RPM-TUTORIAL.md) is an example. |
| Redpanda       | Adopt one or more sources to use [pandaproxy](https://redpanda.com/blog/pandaproxy/) instead. Look [here] (https://materialize.com/taking-streaming-analytics-further-faster-with-redpanda-materialize/) for an example. |
| Redpanda       | Give [WASM transforms (beta)](https://redpanda.com/blog/wasm-architecture/) a try for data pre-processing (_e.g._ cleaning, masking) |
| dbt            | Add a materialized view model that joins streaming data from Redpanda with the static reference data. Check the provided [examples](/sample_project/dbt/models/examples) and [templates](/dbt/models/templates) for pointers. |
| dbt            | Incorporate macros from the [`materialize-dbt-utils`](https://hub.getdbt.com/materializeinc/materialize_dbt_utils/latest/) package into your models                  |
